[UntileKakka](https://www.roblox.com/users/159871912/profile)(AKA) Lee is the creator of the World building sandbox Roblox game. World Architect development started 25th Jun of 2025 and first Opened at 28 June. 

World Architect is supposed to be a game just like World Builder and its Replica but the game has shifted off abit towards adding more feature/experiments into the game.

`said, "I want to make World Architect crazier with these experiments I have in mind, Infact imagine the capability of using our so called 'CompositeType' concept that has unlocked more possibilities in the wiring. Infact I could even add a Messenger Logic that could directly communicate between two world through Logic wiring!"`

Why have I gone so far to making such a game on comeback? Its because World Builder has something that I don't believe Wubby will ever give you. Its the Complexity, its Simplicity, The community or could it possibly be.. The thing that we all grew up with...
